Entity Coordinates
    x is left most point of the entity
    getX()
    y is top most point of the entity
    getY()
    w is the width of the entity
    getW()
    h is the height of the entity
    getH()
    Used for:
    -Placing entities into the world
    -Giving entities the right size sprites and animations

Collision Bounds
    Area covering the in game entity
    getCollBounds()
    getCollBounds().getX()
    getCollBounds().getY()
    getCollBounds().getW()
    getCollBounds().getH()
    Used for:
    -Collision detection

Core Bounds
    Small area in center of entity
    getCoreBounds()
    getCoreBounds().getX()
    getCoreBounds().getY()
    getCoreBounds().getW()
    getCoreBounds().getH()
    Used for:
    -When 2 overlap, increment panic countdown
        Allows a change of state that prioritises movement over all else
        Before starting to take damage equal to 20% of the entity's health * individual resistance stat

Center
    Center of core/entity
    getCenterX()= coreX()+coreW()/2
    getCenterY()= coreY()+coreH()/2
    Used for:
    -Chunk stuff

Coding rules:
Currently no entity can be larger than 5 tiles (1chunk)
    Because of how collision detection currently works
    Checks current and neighbouring chunks
    Not very efficient

Chunklist stores the location of every entity
    Not sure if this is the best way to handle this

Everything is delayed by custom timers
    All timers tick in the timers ArrayList
    Not sure if this is the best way to handle this
    Rename to Timerlist at the very least
